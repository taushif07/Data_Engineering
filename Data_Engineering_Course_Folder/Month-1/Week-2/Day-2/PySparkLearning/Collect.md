PySpark Collect() â€“ Retrieve data from DataFrame

PySpark RDD/DataFrame collect() is an action operation that is used to retrieve all the elements of the dataset (from all nodes) to the driver node. We should use the collect() on smaller dataset usually after filter(), group() e.t.c. Retrieving larger datasets results in OutOfMemory error.
