PySpark StructType & StructField:

PySpark StructType & StructField classes are used to programmatically specify the schema to the DataFrame and create complex columns like nested struct, array, and map columns. StructType is a collection of StructField objects that defines column name, column data type, boolean to specify if the field can be nullable or not and metadata.

Key points:

Defining DataFrame Schemas: StructType is commonly used to define the schema when creating a DataFrame, particularly for structured data with fields of different data types.

Nested Structures: You can create complex schemas with nested structures by nesting StructType within other StructType objects, allowing you to represent hierarchical or multi-level data.

Enforcing Data Structure: When reading data from various sources, specifying a StructType as the schema ensures that the data is correctly interpreted and structured. This is important when dealing with semi-structured or schema-less data sources.

StructType – Defines the structure of the DataFrame
PySpark provides StructType class from pyspark.sql.types to define the structure of the DataFrame.

StructType is a collection or list of StructField objects.

StructField – Defines the metadata of the DataFrame column
PySpark provides pyspark.sql.types import StructField class to define the columns which include column name(String), column type (DataType), nullable column (Boolean) and metadata (MetaData)
